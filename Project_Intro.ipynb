    "As we all know  Pizza is one of the most favorite food item. In this project, I will create a analysis of neighborhoods in Staten Island, New York to determine which of the neighborhoods are optimal location for opening a Pizza Place. There are many Pizza Places in Staten Island, New York. It is difficult for contractor to start a Pizza Place in such area. Also, the contractor cannot open Pizza place near other pizza place locations. So it is essential for the contractor to find optimal location for the Pizza Place. Optimal location should be away from other pizza places and in the neighborhoods where pizza places are not present. \n",
